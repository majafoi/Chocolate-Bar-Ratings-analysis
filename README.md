# Chocolate-Bar-Ratings-analysis


Hello, everyone!
This time, I’m going to make an analysis of a dataset called Chocolate Bar Ratings. The main goal is to show various statistical methods used on this dataset, without any particular conclusions.

**SKILL SHOWN - EDA, CORRELATION AND REGRESSION ANALYSIS**

We all know that chocolate is one of the favorite food in the whole world, possibly even yours, so you must’ve know that every chocolate has its own flavor and texture.
The database I found on Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings) (there is an updated version on the original page - http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html), focuses only on plain dark chocolate.

Table of content is:
  1) Summaries - FIVENUM and graphics
  2) Correlation analysis + Shapiro-Wilk testing + testing for normality
  3) Regression analysis
