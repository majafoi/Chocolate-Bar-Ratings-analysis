This repository is about an analysis of a dataset called Chocolate Bar Ratings.

We all know that chocolate is one of the favorite food in the whole world, possibly even yours, so you mustâ€™ve know that every chocolate has its own flavor and texture.
The database I found on Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings) (there is an updated version on the original page - http://flavorsofcacao.com/chocolate_database.html), focuses only on plain dark chocolate.
